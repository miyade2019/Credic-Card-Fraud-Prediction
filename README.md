# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Prediction Dataset
📄 About This Dataset
This dataset contains transactional data aimed at detecting fraudulent credit card activities. 🕵️‍♂️ It is specifically designed for building and evaluating machine learning models in the context of fraud detection. Fraudulent transactions are rare, making this a classic case of imbalanced data classification. ⚖️

# 🔑 Key Features
💼 Transactions: Each row represents a unique transaction.
# 📊 Features:
The dataset includes anonymized numerical features labeled V1, V2, ..., V28.
⏳ Time: Indicates the seconds elapsed between the first transaction and each subsequent transaction.
💲 Amount: Represents the monetary value of the transaction.
🎯 Target Variable:
Class: Binary value where 0 indicates a legitimate transaction ✅ and 1 indicates a fraudulent one 🚨.
🎯 Purpose
# This dataset is suitable for:

🤖 Machine Learning Classification: Training models to classify fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding patterns, distributions, and correlations.
⚖️ Imbalanced Data Challenges: Experimenting with techniques like SMOTE, undersampling, oversampling, etc.

# 🛠️ Instructions for Use
🧹 Data preprocessing may be required to scale features and address class imbalance.
📈 Always evaluate models using appropriate metrics like AUC-ROC, Precision-Recall, etc., due to the imbalanced nature of the data.
